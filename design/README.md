# README

This directory contains all the documentation for the database design of Treeleaves.

## Document Structure

The documentation is split up into two categories. General and specific.

### General

General documents are documents useful for contributors who would like to make improvements or develop plugins.

These documents outline standard best practices for the design of keys, fields and tables for the database.

- `Field Spec Classes.md`: Establishes general field specification classes referenced in the design.
- `General Database Design.md`: Establishes the general rationale for the general design of the keys, fields, and tables for any database

### Specific

Specific documents contain more implementation details and are useful for writing actual features.

The specific documents are an application of the general database design practices, and are more descriptive
in order to show more detail and provide explanation.

- `Design.md`: Document that outlines the entire database's design with respect to the fields, keys, and tables created.
- `Fields.md`: Document that specifies the complete field specifications for every field in all our tables.
